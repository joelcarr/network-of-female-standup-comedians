      <h1>The Network of Female Standup Comedians in the UK</h1>
      <p>Explore the network map below. Each circle represents one comedian. Hover over a circle to see the comedian's
        photo (as taken from Twitter). Click on the circle to see the comedian's Twitter feed. You can search for and
        highlight a comedian by using Ctrl-F (your normal browser search function). There is an explanation of how this
        was generated below.</p>
      <h2 id="studying-standup-comedy-in-the-uk">Studying Standup Comedy in the UK</h2>
      <p>I have a professional interest in standup comedy and how it can be used to communicate ideas to a diverse
        audience. As a Web Science researcher, it's also interesting to me how this grass-roots arts industry organises
        itself with minimal input from funding organisations. There are different stakeholders - performers, venues,
        promoters, event organisers, agents, festivals, pubs, clubs - and newcomers to standup have to start developing
        their skills (at open mic nights) and their network of contacts. What role does the Web play in this -
        Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, edfringe.com, chortle.co.uk, NextUp - the various social and media
        platforms that allow comedians to be seen and to connect with their peers and their audience. How does the
        Edinburgh Fringe festival use the Web to engage tens of thousands of perfomers with millions of visitors (mainly
        tourists) in a single month?</p>

          alt="Network graph showing twitter interations from a collection of female comedians." loading="lazy">
      </div>
      <p>The network graph above represents a (mainly) crowd-sourced view of UK, female standup comedians. Initiated by
        a Twitter request to tag "your favorite [sic] female comedians", the 267 responses were mined for Twitter
        account names (729) which were then examined to filter out non-comedians (a suprising number of US politicians
        were nominated), non-UK-based comedians (the request was originally posted by an American comedian, but it
        quickly gained traction from a UK audience) and male comedians. Various other accounts were added by
        scrutinising followers of those accounts resulting in 345 identified Twitter accounts. Tweets between all pairs
        of those accounts (ie response tweets and mentions) were obtained (limited to the last 100 tweets to any
        individual) to form a conversational graph based on that network. This graph is drawn as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A line is drawn between two accounts if one account has replied to the other or mentioned the other.</li>
        <li>The more often a pair of accounts have corresponded, the thicker the line between them and the closer they
          are drawn together</li>
        <li>The more followers an account has, the bigger its circle is drawn</li>
        <li>The graph is coloured according to different "cliques" or regions where those in that region tend to talk to
          each other more often than they do to people outside the region.</li>
        <li>The nodes in the graph are labelled with the performer's Twitter account name. Hovering over the node will
          show their Twitter avatar and clicking on the node will take you to their Twitter profile page.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
      <p>This is not a true map of all of the UK's female standup comedians: it's just what can be seen of them from
        Twitter. Not all performers use Twitter. Many prefer Instagram as a way of communicating with their audience.
        They will either be missing from this page, or appear less well-connected than they really are.</p>
      <p>Who counts as a UK female standup? Performers are often identified as "comedians" in their writeups, reviews
        and Twitter bios. I have used locations, recent gigs and pronouns to help make that decision. How do I
        discriminate between comedy actors and standups? Poorly - if there is any evidence that they have done gigs
        recently, they're in.</p>
      <p>How thorough have I been? I have not yet tried scraping names from open night gig set lists and looking up
        Twitter accounts. That'll come when I have some resources. Having said that, I do have a decade of Edinburgh
        Fringe PDFs to hand. Hmmm.....</p>
      <p>Is it problematic that a 56-year-old white male gets to act as gatekeeper to an artefact claiming to represent
        female accomplishment? Absolutely. Why do it then? Because women shouldn't solely have the burden of promoting
        female talent and leveling up the playing field a bit. Any voluteers to help? See instructions below for
        contributing names.</p>
      <p>Is this this map useful? Insightful? Does it add any knowledge? The network visualisation algorithms do tend to
        group comedians together broadly according to the stages of their careers. This probably reflects some form of
        homophily - professional comedians communicating mainly with their peers, club comics responding to people that
        they work with, and open mic comics tweeting people they see frequently on the open mic circuit. More work
        required!</p>
