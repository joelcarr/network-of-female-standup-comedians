    <h1>The Network of Female Standup Comedians in the UK</h1>
    <p>Explore the network map below. Each circle represents one comedian. Hover over a circle to see the comedian's
      photo (as taken from Twitter). Click on the circle to see the comedian's Twitter feed. You can search for and
      highlight a comedian by using Ctrl-F (your norml browser search function). There is an explanation of how this was
      generated below.</p>
    <h2 id="studying-standup-comedy-in-the-uk">Studying Standup Comedy in the UK</h2>
    <p>I have a professional interest in standup comedy and how it can be used to communicate ideas to a diverse
      audience. As a Web Science researcher, it's also interesting to me how this grass-roots arts industry organises
      itself with minimal input from funding organisations. There are different stakeholders - performers, venues,
      promoters, event organisers, agents, festivals, pubs, clubs - and newcomers to standup have to start developing
      their skills (at open mic nights) and their network of contacts. What role does the Web play in this - Instagram,
      Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, edfringe.com, chortle.co.uk, NextUp - the various social and media platforms that
      allow comedians to be seen and to connect with their peers and their audience. How does the Edinburgh Fringe
      festival use the Web to engage tens of thousands of perfomers with millions of visitors (mainly tourists) in a
      single month?</p>

    </div>
    <p>The network graph above represents a (mainly) crowd-sourced view of UK, female standup comedians. Initiated by a
      Twitter request to tag "your favorite [sic] female comedians", the 267 responses were mined for Twitter account
      names (729) which were then examined to filter out non-comedians (a suprising number of US politicians were
      nominated), non-UK-based comedians (the request was originally posted by an American comedian, but it quickly
      gained traction from a UK audience) and male comedians. Various other accounts were added by scrutinising
      followers of those accounts resulting in 345 identified Twitter accounts. Tweets between all pairs of those
      accounts (ie response tweets and mentions) were obtained (limited to the last 100 tweets to any individual) to
      form a conversational graph based on that network. This graph is drawn as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A line is drawn between two accounts if one account has replied to the other or mentioned the other.</li>
      <li>The more often a pair of accounts have corresponded, the thicker the line between them and the closer they are
        drawn together</li>
      <li>The more followers an account has, the bigger its circle is drawn</li>
      <li>The graph is coloured according to different "cliques" or regions where those in that region tend to talk to
        each other more often than they do to people outside the region.</li>
      <li>The nodes in the graph are labelled with the performer's Twitter account name. Hovering over the node will
        show their Twitter avatar and clicking on the node will take you to their Twitter profile page.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
    <p>Not all performers use Twitter. Many prefer Instagram as a way of communicating with their audience.</p>
    <p>Not all performers have been identified - this is very London-centric at the moment.</p>
    <p>Having said that I'm very keen to work on this to improve its coverage.</p>
    <p>Is this useful? Does it say anything? It does tend to group comedians together broadly according to the stages of
      their careers. This probably reflects some form of homophily - that professional comedians communicate mainly with
      their peers, and that club comics respond to people that they work with, and that open mic comics will tweet
      people they see frequently on the open mic circuit. More work required!</p>
